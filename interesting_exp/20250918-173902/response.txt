Question: Find the true definition of select1 that is being called in function encoding1
None
1. Analyze the calling function context to understand how select1 is being used
2. Examine the retrieved documents between <START_OF_CONTEXT> and <END_OF_CONTEXT> to identify all candidate definitions of select1
3. Determine which specific definition is being called based on:
   - Function parameter types and counts
   - Template arguments (if applicable)
   - Object type and inheritance hierarchy
   - Function signature matching
   - Context of the call site
4. If multiple valid candidates exist, explain why one is more likely than others
5. Provide the exact code snippet with line numbers if available
6. Include the file path for each found declaration/definition
7. If the target cannot be resolved with the given context, state this clearly
---------- Output Format ----------
You MUST output EXACTLY in this format, no extra text, no introduction, no summary.
